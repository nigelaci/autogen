AutoGen agents are customizable, conversable, and can operate in ous modes that employ combinations of LLMs; human inputs, and tools.  Using AutoGen, developers can also flexibly define agent interaction behaviors Both natural language and computer code can be used to program flexible conversation patterns for different applications. AutoGen serves as generic framework for building diverse applications of various complexities and LLM capacities.  Em- pirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in many example applications, with domains ranging from mathematics, coding, question answer- operations research; online decision-making, entertainment; etc . 1Corresponding author: Email: auto-gen @outlook_com Ilgithub_ com/microsoft/autogen LiuF plot They loop: vari- ing; Zhttps:\n"
